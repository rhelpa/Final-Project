    JavaScript Events

        Use at least three event-driven interactions (click, change, input, mouseover), wired to DOM elements.

    Array Usage

        Use at least one array to store data that is meaningfully used in the program (list of products, options, pages of text, restaurants).

        The array can be static or partially populated from user input.

    Form-Based Interaction

        Include at least one HTML form that captures user data (text input, select, radio buttons, checkboxes, range sliders).

        Form submissions or input changes must trigger behavior in your JavaScript (validation, filtering, calculation, or personalization).

    Image Interactivity

        At least one image must be changed or altered based on user interaction. Examples: swap image source, change size, apply a CSS class that animates/filters the image, hide/show an image.

    Loop

        Use at least one loop (for, while, for…of, etc.) to process or display data (for example, building a list from an array).

    Conditional Logic

        Use at least one conditional (if, else if, switch, etc.) that changes program behavior depending on user input or state.

    DOM Manipulation – Create Content

        Use JavaScript DOM methods to create new elements or text nodes and insert them into the page (dynamically build a list, cards, messages).

    DOM Manipulation – Styling/Classes

        Use JavaScript to change the appearance or layout of elements by adding/removing/changing CSS classes or styles (show/hide sections, highlight active choices).

    Functions

        Write at least three named functions (not counting anonymous arrow functions directly assigned as event listeners or timers).

        These functions should encapsulate meaningful tasks ( example: calculateTotal(), renderResults(), loadPage(pageIndex)).

    Code Quality

        Use meaningful variable and function names.

        Include clear comments explaining non-obvious logic.

        Remove all debugging statements like console.log before submission.
